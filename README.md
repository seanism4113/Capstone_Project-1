# DreamReads

DreamsReads is a minimal recreation of GoodReads, the popular app where users keep track of their book habits and goals.

### DreamReads allows users to:

- Browse and search books from the Google Books API
  - Google Books API allows applications to perform full text searches and retrieve book information
  - In the Dream Reads app the following fields are retreived from the API: Specialized book id, Title, Authors, Description, Book cover image, Book avg rating, Page count, Date of publish, Publishers, and Book categories.
- Add books to three shelves/lists (Want to Read, Currently Reading, Read)
- Browse books that have been added to the user's Mybooks site.
- Shelves can be updated based on the book status.
- Rate books on a list on a 1-5 star scale
- Leave a review for books on a list
